# prime-factors
This program determines if a number can be factored as exactly two primes, or itself is a prime. It is implemented based on Sieve of Eratosthenes.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* GCC
* UNIX Shell OR Windows PowerShell

### Download source code and compile
The following instructions are presented using Bash in macOS:
```
# Change to HOME directory
$ cd ~

# Clone this repo and 'cd' into it
$ git clone https://github.com/jellycsc/prime-factors.git
$ cd prime-factors/

# Let's compile.
$ gcc -Wall -std=gnu99 -o pfact pfact.c 
```

### Usage
```
Usage: pfact n
```

### Example
```
$ ./pfact 15
[pid = 37241] {FILTER} m is 2
[pid = 37242] {FILTER} m is 3
15 3 5
Number of filters = 2
$ ./pfact 311
[pid = 37244] {FILTER} m is 2
[pid = 37245] {FILTER} m is 3
[pid = 37246] {FILTER} m is 5
[pid = 37247] {FILTER} m is 7
[pid = 37248] {FILTER} m is 11
[pid = 37249] {FILTER} m is 13
[pid = 37250] {FILTER} m is 17
311 is prime
Number of filters = 7
```
